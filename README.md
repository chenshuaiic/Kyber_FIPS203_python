Kyber_FIPS203 in Python
About
NIST published the latest draft of Kyber[https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd]. There are a few modifications compared with the original one[https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/software.shtml]. I tried to implement kyber_FIPS203 in python based on the previous work published by Dominik Klein in here [https://github.com/asdfjkl/pyky] which is a fabulous work that easy to be modified.

You can use this script to verify your own implementation. You can replace my data in scripts by you own data in hex which is useful for debugging.

Again! This just a toy implementation to better understand the algorithm
Again, modified based on the [https://github.com/asdfjkl/pyky]
How To Use
Just take a look at test_FIPS203_kyber512.py and run it like: python3 test_FIPS203_kyber512.py
